-- Objective:
-- The goal of this analysis is to understand how horsepower and fuel efficiency (mileage in MPG) vary across different car makes in 2023, and to identify which manufacturers balance performance and efficiency most effectively.


-- Key Objective from Analysis:
-- * From the analysis, I observed clear trade-offs between horsepower and fuel efficiency.
-- * Brands like Tesla and Toyota deliver strong mileage while maintaining respectable horsepower, making them attractive for buyers prioritizing both performance and eco-friendliness.
-- * Meanwhile, some luxury and performance-oriented brands focus more on power, often sacrificing fuel efficiency.

-- ðŸ“Œ Recommendations
-- 1. Highlight balanced brands like Tesla, Toyota, and Honda as examples of car makes achieving strong efficiency without losing performance.
-- 2. Advise performance-focused brands (e.g., Dodge, BMW) to explore hybrid or electric options to improve efficiency while keeping their horsepower strengths.
-- 3. Encourage car buyers to compare trade-offs between fuel savings and performance based on their driving needs, using makes that lead in balance as benchmarks.
