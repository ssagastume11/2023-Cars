-- Objective:
-- Transform the cleaned 2023 Cars dataset in BigQuery to ensure consistency, accuracy, and usability for analysis. This includes handling missing values, standardizing categorical fields, and creating derived metrics that will support meaningful insights.

-- Key Actions:
-- * Handle missing or null values in key numeric fields (e.g., replace with averages, medians, or leave as NULL depending on context).
-- * Standardize categorical values (e.g., ensure consistent naming for body types, fuel types, and transmissions).
-- * Create derived fields for deeper analysis (e.g., price-to-horsepower ratio, efficiency score based on mileage).
-- * Validate transformations by checking distributions and summary statistics.
